Collision Detection Notes

BVH - Bounded Volume Hierarchy

Build top down or bottom up?
Approach to subdividing / partitioning mesh while building BVH?

What shape of bounding object?
 - sphere
 - ellipsoid
 - AABB
 - OABB
 - swept rectangle?

Rebuild strategy?
 - always rebuild
 - partial rebuild (top half of tree?)
 - use vertex velocity to 'loosen' bounds, rebuild when growth threshold exceeded
 - rebuild recently visited nodes?
